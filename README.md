# Hotel-Reservation-System

The Hotel Reservation System is a Java-based application that interacts with a MySQL database to manage hotel room reservations. 
The system allows users to reserve rooms, view reservations, update or delete reservations, and retrieve room numbers based on reservation IDs. It features a console-based user interface and handles SQL operations like inserts, updates, and deletes.

Key technologies used include:

Java: For building the application logic and user interface.

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): For connecting and executing SQL queries with the MySQL database.

MySQL: The database management system storing reservation data.
